## IntelliJ

If you want to use IntelliJ you can use the Community Edition, but it is also possible to get the Ultimate Edition for free as a student.

If you are using IntelliJ and want to run the DesktopLauncher and the GomokuServer with one click on the 'Run' button, then you can create a compound launcher. Have a look at the **IntelliJ_Compound.md** file located in the **help** folder.
