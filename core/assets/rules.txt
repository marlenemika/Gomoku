Opening

Player 1 starts with placing two black stones and one white stone.
Player 2 then can decide if he plays with the black stones initially.
If so, it's the turn of Player 1 again.
Otherwise he can choose the white stones and places one more white stone.
After that, it's the turn of Player 1 again.
If he wants Player 1 to decide which colour he wants to play, he places another
black and white stone. Then Player 1 either chooses black and it's the turn of
Player 2 or he chooses white, places one white stone and it's the turn of
Player 2 again.

Game Procedure

After Opening, Player 1 and Player 2 alternately place stones on the board until
the Win Condition is fulfilled.

Win Condition

First player that has exactly 5 stones in one row, column or diagonal line wins
the game. Watch out! If there are more than 5 stones in a row, you don't win!

Game Over

Both players lose if the whole board is placed with stones without ever having
fulfilled the win condition.
